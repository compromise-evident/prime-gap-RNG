Version 1.0.0   Actually, "digit_length" can go as low as 50,  but then enhanced
                average gap makes  bit occurrence  shaky; you'll need to  adjust
                "enhanced_average_gap" for your "digit_length" until you see bit
                occurrences are ~equal. See analysis file created automatically.
                "enhanced_average_gap" is best for  200-digit values and higher.
